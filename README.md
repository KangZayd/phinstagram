# Phinstagram – Instagram Scrape / Proxy / API

A simple PHP snippet to get the last instagram images by a username i.e. [instagram.com/sounden](http://instagram.com/sounden) on your own webpage.

# Why did I create Phinstagram?

Well I wanted to get the last images from my [Instagr.am](http://instagr.am) account without connecting it to third party apps.
I could not find any public RSS or JSON feeds, so I did this simple PHP scrape/proxy/ script that will act like a API scraping instagrams own site.
